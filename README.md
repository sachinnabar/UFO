Project Overview
•	The purpose of this analysis was to JavaScript to build a dynamic web page that could accept user inputs and visually adjust accordingly to reflect that interaction. 
•	This was done by inserting our JavaScript code into an HTML page. CSS, Bootstrap and Chrome DevTools were used to customize the page and test the code throughout. 
•	The project is based on inserting a table populated with data that we wanted to display into the web page, and then adding filters to the table which would allow users to refine their search.
•	The end result was to have a web page that presented the data, that was visually appealing, and that was interactive.

Goals
•	Build a table function, loop through each function, and append a row to the HTML table, adding each object into a cell.
•	Add filters.
•	Design the web page with Bootstrap.
•	Customize the page.

Summary
•	The dynamic webpage performs the function and is visually appealing however the page needs some changes to be made so Dana can have more interacting page.
•	We must erase all the input in filters to return to full data set in the table. May be reset button can be added so the data entered can be cleared.
•	As the current table only features one entry outside of US. It can be edited to get more data about places outside US. Table can also be edited to show State or Province column instead of just State as countries other that US may not have divisions as State.
